----------------------- MODULE TokenTransfer8 ---------------------------------
(*
 * This is an example of a very simplistic token transfer
 * for presentation purposes.
 * Do not use it in production, as it may lead to loss of tokens.
 *
 * Version 8: introducing basic denominations
 * Version 7: introducing basic packet receive from source
 * Version 6: introducing basic packet send from source
 * Version 5: introducing an inductive invariant for Apalache
 * Version 4: bounding the amounts to help the model checkers
 * Version 3: fixing the invariants and introducing more
 * Version 2: let the banks do the local banking
 * Version 1: introducing data structures
 *
 * Igor Konnov, 2021

(*************************** OPERATORS ***************************************)
\* For simplicity, we fix the name of the escrow account.
\* In ICS20, one introduces one escrow account per channel.
Escrow == "escrow"

\* For simplicity, we call the coin native if it has the same name as the chain
Native(chain) == chain

\* @type: (DADDR -> Int, Set(DADDR)) => Int;
SumAddresses(amounts, Addrs) ==
    LET Add(sum, addr) == sum + amounts[addr] IN
    FoldSet(Add, 0, Addrs)

\* @type: (DADDR -> Int, CHAIN) => Int;
ChainSupply(amounts, chain) ==
    SumAddresses(amounts, {chain} \X ACCOUNTS \X { Native(chain) })

(************************** PROPERTIES ***************************************)

\* every bank always has reserves
ReservesInv ==
    \A chain \in CHAINS:
        banks[chain, "reserve", Native(chain)] > 0

\* no bank account goes negative
NoNegativeAccounts ==
    \A address \in DOMAIN banks:
        banks[address] >= 0

\* the supply remains constant
ChainSupplyUnchanged ==
    \A chain \in CHAINS:
        LET supply == ChainSupply(banks, chain) IN
        supply = GENESIS_SUPPLY[chain]

\* for each in-fly packet, there is enough money in the escrow account
InFlyPacketIsSecured ==
    \A p \in sentPackets:
        banks[p.src, Escrow, p.data.denom] >= p.data.amount

\* This property should produce a counterexample that demonstrates
\* that a foreign denomination can reach a blockchain
NoForeignCoins ==
    \A chain \in CHAINS, acc \in ACCOUNTS, d \in DENOMS:
            d /= Native(chain) => banks[chain, acc, d] = 0
